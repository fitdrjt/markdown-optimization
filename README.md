# markdown-optimization
A machine learning project that simulates and recommends optimal markdowns to maximize retail revenue

## Overview
In the retail world, giving discounts is a common strategy to boost sales. However, bigger discounts don’t always mean bigger profits. Sometimes, a lower price brings higher volume but ends up hurting total revenue. This project aim to identify the optimal markdown that doesn't just drive sales, but also improves overall revenue. By analyzing historical sales and pricing data, machine learning models were used to simulate how different levels of discounts affect sales.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning-based simulation tool that helps identify the optimal markdown (discount) for each product group, considering multiple factors such as price, seasonality, brand, and historical sales performance.

## What This Project Does
•	Uses machine learning to predict sales performance after applying various markdown levels.

•	Simulates multiple price scenarios to find the markdown that maximizes revenue (not just sales).

•	Compares results against a baseline (historical sales with original price) to calculate revenue improvement.
